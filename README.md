# Placebook, No Relation

Turn the world into a living AR canvas. Place digital art, messages, and drawings at real-world locations using WebXR and GPS.

## How it Works

- **Drop art anywhere**: Find a wall or surface nearby; add your art to that spot in AR.
- **Choose who sees it**: Make your creation public or limit it to friends.
- **Explore & contribute**: Discover layered art wherever you go—every wall becomes a digital page.

## Key Features

- **Location-based AR**: Art is anchored by GPS and sticks to real walls via AR plane detection.
- **Audience control**: You decide who can see each piece.
- **Collaborative storytelling**: The community—or just your friends—builds the mural together.

## Development Note
Building in small, testable increments to ensure reliability before adding more features.
